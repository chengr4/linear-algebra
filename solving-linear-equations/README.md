# Solving Linear Equation

## Identity Matrix 單位矩陣

I = identity matrix (單位矩陣)

```
n = 5
1 0 0 0 0
0 1 0 0 0
0 0 1 0 0
0 0 0 1 0
0 0 0 0 1
```
- For any n*n matrix A `AI = IA = A`

## Inverse Matrix 反矩陣

Definition: An n*n matrix A is **invertable**, if there exists a matrix B such that `BA=I && AB=I` => B is an **inverse** of A
